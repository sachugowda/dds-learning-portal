# DDS Learning Portal – Human + AI Adaptive Teaching

This portal is designed as a **Human + AI teaching assistant** for the Distributed Database Systems (DDS) subject. It combines your explanations as a professor with AI‑driven, personalized practice so that every student can learn at their own pace, instead of only listening in a traditional classroom and passively taking notes.

## 🧠 Why Human + AI, not only classroom lectures?

In a traditional class, the model is mostly:

- Professor explains → students listen → maybe a few students ask questions → everyone gets the **same examples and same pace**.

The portal changes this by adding three layers on top of your teaching:

- **Structured concept flow per topic**: Each Content Session (CS1–CS7) breaks the syllabus into small, clear topics with short explanations, real‑world examples, and dedicated simulations/animations. Students see the same core ideas you teach in class, but in a **step‑by‑step, self‑paced way**.
- **Interactive simulations instead of static board diagrams**: Storage architectures, RAID, distributed requests, schema integration, security levels, etc. are all visual and clickable. Students can replay animations many times until the mental model is clear.
- **AI tutor + adaptive testing**: After your explanation, the AI tutor and AI quiz engine personalize practice to each student’s doubts and understanding.

This Human + AI loop typically increases learning compared to only “professor explaining, students listening”, because students:

- Actively manipulate concepts (simulations) instead of just seeing drawings.
- Ask unlimited questions without feeling shy (AI tutor).
- Receive fresh, use‑case based questions each time (adaptive AI test), not the same fixed quiz for everyone.

You still control the **syllabus, structure, and pedagogy**; AI only supports and personalizes the practice around it.

## 📚 What the student experiences

1. **Subject home (index.html)**  
   - Sees the **subject overview**, 8‑module content structure, and **learning outcomes (LO1–LO5)**.  
   - Configures a personal **Google Gemini API key** (free tier) to enable AI tutor and adaptive testing.

2. **Main learning portal (portal.html)**  
   - Left side: **CS 1–16** as content sessions (mapped to your syllabus).  
   - Top: horizontal **topic tabs** within each session (e.g. Distributed Systems, RAID, Fragmentation, Multilevel Access, etc.).  
   - Center: for each topic, a blend of:
     - Short, professor‑style explanation.
     - Real‑world examples (banks, hospitals, e‑commerce, universities, etc.).
     - A focused simulation/animation with clear instructions.

3. **AI Tutor (“Ask AI”) – Personalized explanation layer**  
   - Students can **click the “Ask AI Tutor about this topic” button** or **right‑click selected text** to:
     - Ask follow‑up questions in natural language.
     - Request alternative explanations.
     - Get real‑world use‑cases or simpler analogies.
   - The tutor always receives the context: **current CS and topic**, so explanations stay aligned with the DDS syllabus, not random internet content.

4. **AI Adaptive Test – Personalized assessment layer**  
   - For each CS, students can start an **adaptive AI test**:
     - Questions are **generated by Gemini**, based on the specific session topics (e.g. RAID, fragmentation, multilevel security, etc.).
     - Questions are **scenario‑based**, not simple definition recall.
     - The engine keeps generating new questions until the student reaches a correct‑answer streak (e.g. 5 correct), indicating a good grasp.
     - After each answer, the student gets a **detailed explanation** (why the correct option is right, and why others are wrong).
   - This mimics an oral viva/practice session, but can be repeated anytime, with fresh questions, outside classroom hours.

5. **Notes, bookmarks, and progress**  
   - **Notes:** Students can highlight any text and add it to their own notes panel, organized by CS and topic.
   - **Bookmarks:** Save key topics to revisit before exams.
   - **Progress tracking:** Stored in `localStorage`, so each student’s browser remembers what they have completed.

## 🚀 Quick Start (Teacher or Student)

1. **Open the home page**  
   - Open `index.html` in a browser (locally or via GitHub Pages).
   - Read the subject overview, modules, and learning outcomes.

2. **Configure Gemini (once)**  
   - Create a free Gemini API key in Google AI Studio.
   - Paste the key into the field on `index.html` and click **Save** and **Test Connection**.

3. **Enter the portal**  
   - Click **“Enter Learning Portal”** to open `portal.html`.
   - Choose a Content Session (CS1–CS7) from the left sidebar.
   - Move topic by topic using the horizontal tabs; read, watch simulations, and interact.

4. **Use AI to personalize learning**  
   - Ask the AI tutor questions whenever something is unclear.
   - Run the **AI Test** at the end of a session until you get a strong streak of correct answers.
   - Take notes and add bookmarks for revision.

## 🔧 Technical Notes

- Fully client‑side (static HTML/CSS/JS) – ideal for GitHub Pages hosting.
- Uses `localStorage` for:
  - Progress tracking.
  - Notes and bookmarks.
  - Saved Gemini API key (per browser).
- `gemini-api.js` automatically:
  - Tries the most powerful available Gemini model first.
  - Falls back to lighter models when quota is reached or a model is not available.
  - Surfaces clear messages when free‑tier quota is temporarily exhausted, guiding students to keep learning with simulations and notes and try again later.

This design lets you, as the professor, focus on **high‑value human teaching** (intuition, guidance, feedback in class), while the portal + AI handles **repetition, practice, and personalized explanations** outside class – increasing overall learnability compared to a purely lecture‑driven approach. 🎓🤝🤖
